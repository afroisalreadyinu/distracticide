# distracticide

An extension for reminding you of better things to do when you get distracted again.


## Developing

On Firefox, open the profiles page by going to `about:profiles`, and create a new profile for
extension debugging. Start a browser session in this profile, open `about:debugging`, click on "Load
temporary Add-on", and select `manifest.json`. The extension is now running. If you want to view the
debug console for the extension, click on "Inspect" next to the freshly installed extension.
